            <p>
                Hello there! I'm Niraj Dhakal, a curious and passionate individual navigating through life's adventures with enthusiasm and purpose. Born and raised in Palpa, Nepal, I've always had a thirst for knowledge and a love for exploration.
            </p>
            <p>
                My journey is a tapestry woven with diverse experiences and interests. From graduating with honors in Electronics and Communication Engineering to embarking on a transformative solo trek through the breathtaking landscapes of the Himalayas, I've learned the value of resilience, adaptability, and empathy.
